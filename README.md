# CookieNough blocks cookie notices #

Don’t you hate those annoying cookie notices?


I don’t care if you’re setting cookies, just give me the site I asked for.


With CookieNough (like “Cookie Dough” but it sounds like “Cookie No”, get it?) the future of cookie warnings is finally here.


Never be notified of cookies being set again! Browse in peace!
